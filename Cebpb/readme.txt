This directory contains all of the files associated with the DNA binding protein with gene name Cebpb.

Files:

Cebpb.zip

- All files in this directory

Cebpb_contig8mers.txt

-  Contains statistics for the contiguous 8-mer, which are represented by each row.  The columns are as follows:

 5 columns:
   1: 8-mer sequence
   2: complement of 8-mer sequence
   3: Enrichment Score
   4: Median Intensity Signal
   5: z-scores calculated from the median SI data.

Cebpb_*.pwm
Cebpb_*_RC.pwm

- The position weight matrices (frequency matrices) for the motif and reverse complement of the motif.

Cebpb_*.png
Cebpb_*_RC.png

- Images of the motif and reverse complement of the motif for this protein.

Cebpb.zip

- Contains all files in the current directory.

Cebpb_rawdata.txt

- Unprocessed output from the PBM array runs

Cebpb_8mers_top_enrichment.txt

- Contains the normalized enrichment values, median intensity values, and z-scores for the 
  gapped and ungapped 8-mers with enrichment scores greater than or equal to 0.25.  
  The columns are as follows:

   5 columns:
   1: 8-mer sequence
   2: complement of 8-mer sequence
   3: Enrichment Score
   4: Median Intensity Signal
   5: z-scores calculated from the median SI data.
